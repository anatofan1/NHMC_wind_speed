# NHMC_wind_speed

As the planet's energy consumption continues to soar, we are urgently in need of clean alter-naà¦§ves to traditonal fuel sources. As a green, renewable and readily available energy source,wind power is considered a major part of the future global energy landscape. To incorporate wind power to a power grid, and preempt power cuts and surges, an accurate model of windspeed is essential. Previous efforts to model wind speed: 1) first order Markov Chain (FOMC); 2)second order Markov Chain(SOMC)and 3) auto-regressive moving average(ARMA)fail to take into account both the daily and the seasonal variations in wind intensity. This application proposes partitioning the wind speed time series into optimal segments; introducing an index to lessen the impact of seasonal variation and modelling the modified wind speeds as a Non-Homogeneous Markov Chain with a time variable to accommodate daily variation.
